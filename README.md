# Microwave Timer Controller using Raspberry pi 4 and 4 Channel Relay module
This Python GUI program Controls the Relays using GPIO pins present in Raspberry Pi 4. Which is used for Simulating the Controls of Full Featured Microwave Oven with customizability and accuracy.

## Info:
This Python script is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 and serves as a Microwave timer controller with a GUI. The script utilizes the **Tkinter library for the GUI** and **RPi.GPIO for GPIO** control. The timer controller supports preheating, microwaving, grilling, and convection cooking with adjustable time settings. The GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi control corresponding relays(**4 Channel Relay Module**) for each cooking mode.

## Requirements
1) Raspberry pi 4
2) 4 Channel Relay module (8 channel used my project)
3) Female to female jumper wires
